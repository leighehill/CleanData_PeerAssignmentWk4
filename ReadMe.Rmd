## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project ReadMe

The file run_analysis.R does the following:

1. Loads the activity labels, features (variables) into R and converts the names to character fields.
2. Loads the activity values, subject values, and measured data into R and combines into one dataset for test and train.
3. Combines the test and train datasets into one combined dataset.
4. Using regular expressions, filters the features to only ones that are a mean/std and cleans up the names by removing parenthesis.
5. Subset the combined dataset to only features in step 4 and add the column names to the dataset.
6. Using a factor, give the activity values meaningful, text names.
7. Create a second dataset with the mean of each variable for each subject and activity.
